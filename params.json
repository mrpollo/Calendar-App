{"body":"# Calendar App\r\nThis puzzle was sent to me by the Facebook UI Engineering team when I applied for a job back in I think 2010, at that time my entry didn't make it to the second phase in the hiring process, however thats not the point, this is a learning exercise, and lots of fun.\r\n> **Demo http://mrpollo.github.com/Calendar.html**\r\n\r\n## UI Engineering Puzzle\r\n### Part I: Write a function (either PHP or JS) to lay out a series of events on the calendar for a single day.\r\n\r\nEvents will be placed on a canvas.  The top of the canvas represents 9am and the bottom represents 9pm. The width of the canvas will be 620px (10px padding on either side) and the height will be 720px (1 pixel for every minute between 9am and 9pm). The objects should be laid out so that they do not visually overlap on the canvas. If there is only one event at a given time slot, its width should be 600px.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 major constraints:\r\n* Every colliding event must be the same width as every other event that it collides width.\r\n* An event should use the maximum width possible while still adhering to the first constraint.\r\n\r\n> See calendar1.png for an example.\r\n![calendar1.png](https://raw.github.com/mrpollo/Calendar-App/master/image.png)\r\n\r\nThe input to the function will be an array of event objects with the start and end times of the event. Example (JS): \r\n```Javascript\r\n[\r\n    {id : 1, start : 60, end : 120},  // an event from 10am to 11am \r\n    {id : 2, start : 100, end : 240}, // an event from 10:40am to 1pm \r\n    {id : 3, start : 700, end : 720} // an event from 8:40pm to 9pm \r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function should return an array of event objects that have the left and top positions set (relative to the top left of the canvas), in addition to the id, start, and end time.\r\n````javascript\r\n/**\r\n Lays out events for a single  day\r\n\r\n @param array events\r\n An array of event objects. Each event object consists of a start time, end\r\n Time (measured in minutes) from 9am, as well as a unique id. The\r\n Start and end time of each event will be [0, 720]. The start time will\r\n Be less than the end time.  The array is not sorted.\r\n\r\n @return array\r\n An array of event objects that has the width, the left and top positions set,\r\n In addition to start time, end time, and id.\r\n**/\r\n\r\nFunction  layOutDay(events) {\r\n \r\n}\r\n````\r\n### Part II: Use your function from Part I to create a web page that is styled just like the example image calendar2.png with the following calendar events:\r\n\r\n> Image 2\r\n![calendar1.png](https://raw.github.com/mrpollo/Calendar-App/master/image2.png)\r\n\r\n* An event that starts at 9:30am and ends at 11:30am\r\n* An event that starts at 6:00pm and ends at 7:00pm\r\n* An event that starts at 6:20pm and ends at 7:20pm\r\n* An event that starts at 7:10pm pm and ends at 8:10pm\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
